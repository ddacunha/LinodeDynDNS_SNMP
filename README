Linode DynDNS SNMP Updater 
By Daniel Da Cunha <daniel@ddc.im>

Replace the following information in the file:
APIKEY = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' # API Key can be generated from Linode.com
SNMPHOSTNAME = '172.16.1.1'           # ip address of the SNMP enabled router (e.g.: Airport Express)
DOMAIN = 'mydomain.com'               # domain name as per Linode record
RESOURCE = 'home'                     # resource to update (e.g.: home for 'home.mydomain.com')

I let you decide how to schedule the update.

Note, to enable SNMP on Airport Extrem install Airport Utility 5.6 from Apple:

For customers of Linode that use the Linode DNS manager.  Released into the public domain.
